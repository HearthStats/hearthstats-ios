During the Term, and subject to Developer’s compliance with all terms and conditions of these Terms, Crashlytics will provide Developer with access to the Services. As part of the implementation process, Developer will identify a user name and password that will be used to set up Developer’s account. Developer will be responsible and liable for the acts or omissions of any person who accesses the Services using passwords or access procedures provided to Developer. Crashlytics reserves the right to refuse registration of, or to suspend or cancel, login IDs used by Developer to access the Services for any reason, including if Developer violates the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms.

During the Term, and subject to all terms and conditions of these Terms, Crashlytics grants Developer a nonexclusive, nontransferable right and license (without right to sublicense) to (a) access and use the Services (including the Background Materials (as defined below) necessary to use the Services), solely for Developer’s internal business purposes and (b) download, install and use a reasonable number of copies of the Crashlytics software development kit (the “SDK”) and any tools provided as part of the SDK, including, but not limited to, any plugins (collectively, the “Software”) solely in connection with Developer’s authorized use of the Services. Developer may use the Services and the Software for the sole purposes of (i) enabling users of their applications, including Beta Testers, to access and use Beta Applications, (ii) obtaining information regarding the installation, use of and engagement with, and the functionality of Developer’s applications, including reporting on errors or bugs (collectively, “Performance Data”), (iii) improving the functionality of Developer’s applications and related products and services, and (iv) communicating with users, including Beta Testers, about Developer’s applications. Developer’s access and use of the Services shall also comply with all other conditions set forth in all documentation, instructions, end user guides and other documents regarding the Services and Software, in each case that is provided or made available by Crashlytics to Developer in electronic or other form (collectively, “Documentation”). Developer shall comply with all (a) applicable laws, rules and regulations, and (b) any applicable third-party terms, including any third-party terms applicable to Developer’s development and distribution of any application operating on the Android or iOS mobile operating systems, or any other mobile operating system upon which the application is made available and upon which Crashlytics makes the Services available to Developer. Restrictions. Developer shall not directly or indirectly (a) use the Services or any of Crashlytics’s Confidential Information (as defined below) to create any service, software or documentation that is substantially the same or has similar functionality as the Services, (b) disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or use any other means to attempt to discover any source code, algorithms or trade secrets underlying the Services or Background Materials (defined below), except and only to the extent these restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law, (c) encumber, sublicense, transfer, distribute, rent, lease, time-share or use any Crashlytics Properties (as defined below) in any service bureau arrangement or otherwise for the benefit of any third party, (d) adapt, combine, create derivative works of or otherwise modify any Crashlytics Properties, or (e) use or allow the transmission, transfer, export, re-export or other transfer of any product, technology or information it obtains or learns in connection with Developer’s use of the Services in violation of any export control or other laws and regulations of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction.

From time to time, Crashlytics may solicit from Developer or Developer may make, in its sole discretion, suggestions for changes, modifications or improvements to the Services or any other feedback related to Crashlytics or the Services (collectively, “Developer Feedback”). All Developer Feedback shall be solely owned by Crashlytics (including all intellectual property rights therein and thereto) and shall also be Crashlytics’s confidential information. Developer hereby assigns all of its right, title and interest in and to any Developer Feedback to Crashlytics and acknowledges that Crashlytics has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Developer Feedback in any manner, without attribution, and without any obligations or compensation to Developer.

Developer Data. Developer hereby grants Crashlytics a nonexclusive, license-fee free and royalty-free right and license to access, copy, distribute, process and use all information, data and other content provided by Developer, including, without limitation any Beta Application that Developer makes available for testing through the Services any other information, data, or other content provided by Developer, as well all information, data, and other content otherwise received by Crashlytics in connection with Developer’s authorized use of the Services (collectively, “Developer Data”) solely for the purpose of providing the Services and as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms.

Access by Beta Testers; EULA. Developer shall provide to Crashlytics the contact information of any user of Developer’s application(s) whom Developer intends to invite to become a Beta Tester. Developer is solely responsible for determining which users will receive an invitation to become a Beta Tester, and for ensuring the accuracy of any user contact information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (“Developer EULA”); provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with the Terms and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (“Standard EULA”). If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers that is applicable to Developer’s Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers’ use of the Beta Application shall be subject to the Standard EULA. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to Developer’s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the Developer to collect information relating to performance of Developer’s applications, including, without limitation, device state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn on features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g., a user’s e-mail address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement with and functionality of Developer’s applications, and to communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not enable the collection or use of personally identifiable information by way of applications directed at children under 13 via the Services or provide any personally identifiable information collected via such applications to Crashlytics. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy policy (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accurately discloses to its users what information is collected about its users and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users’ activity and otherwise collect information from users. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including, without limitation, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Crashlytics may, at its sole discretion from time to time during the Term of this Agreement, audit Developer Data to verify compliance.

Developer Systems. Developer is responsible for providing (a) all equipment, subscriptions and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems, servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the Services at its facility (collectively, “Developer Systems”). Developer shall ensure that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.

Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any other problems which are related to (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunications, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics’s facilities or control.

Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means, with respect to Crashlytics, all financial, business or technical information disclosed by or for Crashlytics in relation to these Terms that is of a nature that should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary. Except for the specific rights granted by these Terms, neither party receiving Confidential Information hereunder (“Recipient”) may use, copy or disclose any Confidential Information of the party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder (“Discloser”) without Discloser’s prior written consent, and shall use no less than reasonable care to safeguard Discloser’s Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient’s employees, contractors and agents (“Representatives”) with access to Discloser’s Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of these Terms and are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein.

Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its Representatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser’s request at any time, Recipient shall return all of Discloser’s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other’s Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose, and (b) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order.

Proprietary Rights. As used in these Terms: “Background Materials” means all ideas, concepts, inventions, systems, platforms, software (including all Software), interfaces, tools, utilities, templates, forms, Report Formats, techniques, methods, processes, algorithms, know-how, trade secrets and other technologies and information that are used by Crashlytics in providing the Services and Results (including any correction, improvement, derivative work, extension or other modification to the Services made, created, conceived or developed by or for Crashlytics, including at Developer’s request or as a result of feedback provided by Developer to Crashlytics); “Reports” means the reports, charts, graphs and other presentation in which the Results are presented to Developer; “Report Formats” means the formatting, look and feel of the Reports; and “Results” means the work products resulting from the Services that are delivered to Developer by Crashlytics through the Services, and which are based on the Developer Data. For the sake of clarity, Results shall expressly exclude all Background Materials. Developer shall own all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) in and to feedback, suggestions, ideas or other materials and information provided by Beta Testers with respect to any Beta Application (“User Feedback”), the Results and Developer Data. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the Results will be presented to it in a Report, the Report Format of which is Confidential Information and proprietary to Crashlytics. Developer may make a reasonable number of copies of the Reports only for its internal purposes in using the Results. Developer hereby grants to Crashlytics a license-fee free, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable, worldwide right and license to (a) use the Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback, solely for purposes of providing the Services to Developer, (b) use the Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback to create aggregate measures of Services usage, engagement, and performance, and (c) use the Results and aggregated Developer Data, Performance Data and User Feedback to improve the Services generally and for its other business purposes.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
